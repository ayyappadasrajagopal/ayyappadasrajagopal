I am currently pursuing my PhD in Electrical Engineering 🎓 at the Indian Institute of Technology, Palakkad, India 🏛, focusing on research in the area of estimation and control within networked control systems under the guidance of Dr. Shaikshavali Chitraganti. I have a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering 🎓 as well as a Master's degree in Communication Engineering 🎓 from MG University, Kottayam, India 🏛. My research interests encompass estimation in unreliable networks, optimal control systems, advanced robotic system design, and networked control systems ✨. 
I'm a passionate learner who's always willing to learn and work across technologies and domains 💡. I love to explore new technologies and leverage them to solve real-life problems ✨. Apart from that I also love to guide and mentor newbies👨🏻‍💻.
